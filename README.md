### Suffolk County Library Programs
=================

Suffolk County Library Programs is a web app built in 2020 as a proof of concept to provide libraries in Suffolk County, 
NY with a central location to share programs with excess capacity.  The site was live with a small pool of users
before being suspended due to the Covid outbreak.  

The app is built with express.js, mongoDB, and integrates with auth0 to control user logins.
